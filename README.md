## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
In order to run the CRFVoter you need
* Java 8
* Maven

### Installing

```
Navigate to the directory and build project
```

mvn install
```

### Running

#### CLI API
After ```mvn install``` the CLI script will be generated in ```target/CRFVoter.jar```.

Instructions and help will be printed with: Â ```java -jar target/CRFVoter.jar -h```

Example client call:
